  3. Library like numpy, pandas, sklearn also must be installed for data handling, processing data, and building recommending data.


Datasets used from Kaggle :

I have used Google Colab but you can use Jupyter notebook.
Based on that, some of the code snipppets might get changed, but the data processing and recommendation logic remains same.
